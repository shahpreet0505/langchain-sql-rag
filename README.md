🧠 SQL RAG System for MySQL using LangChain, Chroma, Groq & Streamlit

A Retrieval-Augmented SQL Generation System that allows users to ask natural-language questions about a MySQL database.
The system retrieves relevant few-shot SQL examples from a vector store, uses an LLM to synthesize a SQL query, executes it against the database, and returns the final answer.

This project demonstrates:

SQL-aware prompting for LLMs

Few-shot retrieval via semantic similarity

Vector-stored examples using Chroma + HuggingFace embeddings

Safe SQL generation patterns

Real-world LLM application architecture

🚀 Features

Ask questions in plain English → get valid SQL queries

Semantic few-shot retrieval improves accuracy

Query execution against live MySQL database

Supports aggregation logic (SUM, revenue, discounts, etc.)

Designed using LangChain v1.1-style composable chains

Built with Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant (can be swapped)

Streamlit UI for interactive querying
